Threads

Objectives:

1. Introducing threads concepts and POSIX threads library.
2. Implementing popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones.

Problem Statement:

Matrix Multiplication
It is required to implement two variations of this algorithm:
a) The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
b) The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.
For both variations, you have to compute the elapsed time for each of them,
compare them and justify your answer.
The program should read two input matrices in a certain format as mentioned in
the “matrix-readme.txt” file associated with project (Output format is also
mentioned).
